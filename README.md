# Lab: AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Overview

Create a serverless REST API.

## Feature Tasks & Requirements

Create a single resource REST API using a domain model of your choosing, constructed using AWS Cloud Services.

- **Database**: DynamoDB
  - 1 Table required.
- **Routing**: API Gateway
  - **POST**
  - `/people` - Given a JSON body, inserts a record into the database.
  -  returns an object representing one record, by its id (##).
  - **GET**
    - `/people` - returns an array of objects representing the records in the database.
    - `/people/##` - returns an object representing one record, by its id (##).
  - **PUT**
  - `/people/##` - Given a JSON body and an ID (##), updates a record in the database.
  -  returns an object representing one record, by its id (##).
  - **DELETE**
  - `/people/##` - Given an id (##) removes the matching record from the database.
  -  returns an empty object.
- **CRUD Operation Handlers**: Lambda Functions

## Implementation Notes

Work in a non-main branch in a new repository called 'serverless-api'. While your code will all reside in a single repo, your functions will need to be individually .zipped and deployed using common libraries (node_modules) and schema files.

- Create one table for one data model at Dynamo DB.
- Create a `Dynamoose` schema to define the structure of your table.
- Write lambda functions that will separately perform the proper CRUD operation on the database.
- Create your routes using API Gateway.
  - Routes should integrate with the appropriate Lambda function to perform the operation.
